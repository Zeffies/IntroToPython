# IntroToPython
All of the programs I made while going through the introtopython.org tutorial website.

Programs in the main branch are the larger ones that I spent the most time on. Almost everything in the MiscPrograms section are really small answers to example problems in the tutorial. Everything here is just for archival purposes, for me to be able to look back on how far I've progressed as a programmer.

They were all done in Geany, so I didn't have the benefits of an IDE telling me how to format properly or to let me know when things were going to go wrong, I just had to run it and hope it didn't error out. It was a lot more effort, but I think it may have helped me think harder about how to write my programs and made me better for it.

I definitely prefer using a good IDE like PyCharm though, haha.
