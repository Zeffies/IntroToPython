# Make a variable called strength, and set its initial value to 5.
strength = 5
# Print a message reporting the player's strength.
print('Your current strength is %d.\n' % strength)
# Set up a while loop that runs until the player's 
#   strength increases to a value such as 10.
while strength <= 15:
    print('Your current strength is %d.\n' % strength)
    strength = strength + 1
print("You've grown too strong! You've been moved to a new level of the game.")
# Inside the while loop, print a message 
#   that reports the player's current strength.
# Inside the while loop, write a statement that increases the player's strength.
# Outside the while loop, print a message reporting 
#   that the player has grown too strong, 
#   and that they have moved up to a new level of the game.
# Bonus: Play around with different cutoff levels for the value of strength, 
#   and play around with different ways to 
#   increase the strength value within the while loop.
